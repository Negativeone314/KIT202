                <h2>Week 2</h2>
                <p>
                    The learning for the week came from the tutorial as I started with no knowledge of html.
                    <br><br>
                    Techniques learned included using html to create basic page elements including images, input
                    fields, dropdown lists, checkboxes, masked input fields, and hyperlinks. Following the
                    tutorial my confidence in all these fields was very high.
                    <br><br>
                    The most difficult part of this weeks tutorial activity was adding the image since I did
                    it first without knowing how. However, I discovered that an effective tool for learning
                    to add specific html elements was to have the lecture slides from that week open while
                    completing the tutorial.
                    <br><br>
                    Note that I missed the first weeks tutorial so this work was really completed during
                    the week 3 tutorial. I completed the week 2 tutorial task and started work on the
                    week 3 tutorial task during the week 3 tutorial.
                </p>
                <h2>Week 3</h2>
                <p>
                    This week introduced CSS, used to style pages more attractively.
                    <br><br>
                    High confidence with most CSS functions.
                    <br><br>
                    Slight difficulty in targetting specific elements of the html page.
                    <br><br>
                    I was able to complete the week 2 tutorial task and 90% of the week 3 tutorial task
                    during the week 3 tutorial.

                </p>
                <h2>Week 4</h2>
                <p>
                    This week introduce UX and accessibility.
                    <br><br>
                    Greatly increased confidence in using css correctly.
                    <br><br>
                    From week 3 tutorial task: I found correctly styling the cancel/back button without making changes to
                    other links on the page. Speaking to Lake made this much clearer and now I am confident
                    in creating sub-classes to correctly style specific elements.
                    <br><br>
                    Greatly increased confidence in creating sub-classes in CSS and html.
